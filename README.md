#### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project : Peer Graded Assignment

This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

#### Dataset Used

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### Files in the repository 

* `CodeBook.md` a code book that describing all the variables used, the data used and result, and transformations performed to clean up the data.

* `run_analysis.R` is an R script that does the following, as given in the question:
    + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
* `tidydata.txt` is the exported document containing the final document after following the steps described above.
